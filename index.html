                <p>
                    I am a dedicated high school student with interests in engineering, music, and video games. I'm looking forward to continuing my education and exploring career opportunities in the Computer Engineering field.
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing my string instruments; ukulele, acoustic guitar, and electric guitar. I enjoy working out, going to the gym and getting a good run thorugh the day.
                </p>

                    My academic journey has been focused on Cybersecurity. We learned about Artificial Intelligence, Programming, A+ I.T Essentials, Networking, Cybersecurity, and Web Design.
                    As someone who enjoys playing video games on a gaming console, I have always wondered how would it feel to play in a computer. After watching people talk and build their 
                    own gaming computers, I became fascinated about the different components and how they work with eachother. I then realized how fun and educating it would be to build a computer like this hands on. 
                    This alone has set me on a path of interest in computers, technology, and engineering. I have taken multiple programming courses through school 
                    and learning different languages such as HTML, CSS, Java, Bootstrap, and more. We have also learned about circuits, wifi, and networking that interconnects with every piece of technology. 
                    So, as my education continues and my passion in Computer Engineering nourish, I am confident to establish this as my future career.
